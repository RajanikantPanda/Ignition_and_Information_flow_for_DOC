# Ignition_and_Information_flow_for_DOC
The code compute: 
1. Intrinsic Ignition which quantify the alteration of whole-brain integration generated by naturally occurring intrinsic events
2. Tau, which measure the ‘memory depth’ of the signal. 
3. Computational model-based approach which measure the propagation of perturbations by causal spatiotemporal properties of time series given by the network effective connectivity (EC) 
   and the dynamic communicability, i.e. time-dependent graph-like descriptors. From nodal communicability, we capture the capacity of the brain region to receive and broadcast information flow after perturbations.
