The above code compute: 
1. Intrinsic Ignition which quantify the alteration of whole-brain integration generated by naturally occurring intrinsic events
2. Tau, which measure the ‘memory depth’ of the signal. 
3. Computational model-based approach which measure the propagation of perturbations by causal spatiotemporal properties of time series given by the network effective connectivity (EC) 
   and the dynamic communicability, i.e. time-dependent graph-like descriptors. From nodal communicability, we capture the capacity of the brain region to receive and broadcast information flow after perturbations.


TO estimation of effective connectivity you need to instal the pyMOU Python package (https://github.com/mb-BCA/pyMOU) and for the study of responses to exogenous perturbations, you need to instal NetDynFlow package in Python (https://github.com/mb-BCA/NetDynFlow).
